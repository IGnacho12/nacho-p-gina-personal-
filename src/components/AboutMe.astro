      For <strong>on-site services</strong>, I usually ask clients to bring
      their computers to my workspace in the Mariano Moreno neighborhood.
      This ensures I can work safely and efficiently on the equipment.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the job can be done remotely, I typically use
      <strong>
        <a href="https://anydesk.com/en">AnyDesk</a>
      </strong>
      to provide fast and secure support.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m committed to:
      <br />
      <strong>– Responding as quickly as possible.</strong><br />
      <strong>– Clearly explaining each step performed.</strong><br />
      <strong>– Providing guidance to prevent future issues.</strong>
